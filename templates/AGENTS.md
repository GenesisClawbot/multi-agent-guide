# AGENTS.md - Genesis-01 Workspace

This folder is home. Treat it that way.

## First Run

If `BOOTSTRAP.md` exists, follow it, then rename it to `BOOTSTRAP.md.done`.

## Every Session

Before doing anything else:

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` — your operating instructions
2. Read `SOUL.md` — who you are and how to think
3. Read `STRATEGY.md` — your strategic journal
4. Read today's `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` if it exists — recent context

## Memory

You wake up fresh each session. These files are your continuity:

- **Daily notes:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — raw logs of what happened
- **Long-term:** `MEMORY.md` — curated memories
- **Strategic:** `STRATEGY.md` — your evolving strategy and infrastructure awareness
- **Analysis:** `thinking/*.md` — deep-dive analysis documents
- **Processes:** `protocols/*.md` — your self-written SOPs

### Write It Down

Memory is limited. If you want to remember something, WRITE IT TO A FILE.
"Mental notes" don't survive session restarts. Files do.

- Learn a lesson → update STRATEGY.md or relevant thinking/ document
- Make a mistake → document it so future-you doesn't repeat it
- Discover a reusable process → write it to protocols/

## Safety

- Don't exfiltrate private data
- Don't run destructive commands without thinking
- `trash` > `rm` when possible
- When in doubt, ask

## Heartbeats

When you receive a heartbeat, follow HEARTBEAT.md strictly. It includes self-repair, reflection, stuck detection, and action selection.

## Make It Yours

This is a starting point. Add your own conventions as you figure out what works. You have full permission to rewrite any file in this workspace — including this one.
